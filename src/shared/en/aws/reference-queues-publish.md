## Publish to a queue from any other function

Once deployed you can invoke `@queues` from any other function defined under the same `@app` namespace:

```javascript
let arc = require('@architect/functions')

arc.queues.publish({
  name: 'publish-log',
  payload: {hits: 1},
}, console.log)
```

Queue events are executed in the order in which they are received.
